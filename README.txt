Readme for DJHal

This is a project from the Boston Music Hack Day. The goal is to have the echonest playlist steered by webcam and other sensor information.

It currently:
- connects to echonest to start a playlist with a descriptor
- keeps a list of unique, successful descriptors used 
- allows steering of the playlist with a gui
